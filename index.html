            Adlibs in hiphop are words or phrases that rappers add to the end of a line to highlight, emphasise or emote
            their lyrics. They've a distinguishing feature of trap-based hiphop originating from Atlanta and Southern
            states.

            Take the Migos, who are well know for echoing a word or theme at the end of their, or within lines. For
            example, in their breakout song 'Bad and Boujee' opens with

            'Raindrop (Drip), drop-top (Drop-top)
            Smokin' on cookie in the hotbox (Cookie)'

            This breaks up the flow, creating their iconic triplet flow which made its way across some oceans to the
            Vietnamese rap scene.
